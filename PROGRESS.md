## Progress 2/18/2020
This progress if for the first draft of my visual argument. Since my last update, I found a picture of a homeless person sleeping from the legs down. I felt that this picture was a great one to use since the first image I used is the view of a person relaxing in a hammock from the legs down, so this will be a great contrast to that picture from the same perspective. I then cut out the homeless person's legs so that I could apply some filters over them to match the hammock photo's visual style. After that, I had to enlarge and align the two pictures so that I could fit everything in the canvas. I then added text. The image pulls the viewer in with the hammock photo, and I hope that the viewer's eyes naturally read it top-down after seeing this top picture. It reads "politics don't affect me," which I believe will add a personal connection to the viewer if they are a type of person who just 'doesn't do' politics. Then, as their eyes wander down, they will see the homeless person at the same perspective. I hope that with their personal attachment to the top photo heavily contrasted with the bottom photo, it will make them realize that, while politics may not affect them, their lack of interest in politics still affects other people. Finally, I have the call to action, which I think is best if it is short and sweet. It boldly states "DO SOMETHING," which is left up for interpretation. I feel, as long as this poster encourages somebody to take political action, then the visual argument has succeeded. I also added a simple gray background, which I feel doesn't look too stellar, but I'm not sure what to do with it, so I will hopefully get good peer advice on how to improve it.

## Progress 2/13/2020
In this preview, I currently have a picture of a person relaxing on a hammock. I chose this picture as a symbol of somebody living a
priviliged life. This person doesn't necessarily have no problems, but they don't need to worry about how exactly they are going
to survive, pay their bills, or deal with whatever future problems may come. I used a stock picture of a person relaxing in a hammock,
 and the perspective of this picture is purposefully made to look like it is from the viewer's perspective. This is supposed to put
 the viewer into the shoes of this person, if it applies to them. They will feel a personal attachment to this figure, and thus, whatever
 the poster will call for this person to do. I then painstakingly used the pen tool to cut out the background from the image in-between
 each individual string on the hammock. Then, to make the picture less of the main focus, I decided to mess around with the brightness,
  contrast, saturation, and luminance curves. I was satisfied with a somewhat silhoutteish style for the person sitting on the hammock.  
  I learned a lot about how GIMP works, especially the selections and color grading aspects of GIMP. I had slight experience using
  GIMP and Photoshop from middle and high school, but I mostly relied on tools like the magnetic lasso to do all of the selecting for me.
  This project finally made me realize how powerful the pen tool can be when it comes to selecting edges of an image, and also how tedious
  this process is.  
  In the future, I hope to add text to the top of this image that will make it clear to the viewer why I chose to put a picture
  of somebody relaxing on the top. I will then add a picture to contrast the top, with text urging the viewers to take action.
