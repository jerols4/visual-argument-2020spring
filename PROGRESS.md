## Progress 2/13/2020
In this preview, I currently have a picture of a person relaxing on a hammock. I chose this picture as a symbol of somebody living a
priviliged life. This person doesn't necessarily have no problems, but they don't need to worry about how exactly they are going
to survive, pay their bills, or deal with whatever future problems may come. I used a stock picture of a person relaxing in a hammock,
 and the perspective of this picture is purposefully made to look like it is from the viewer's perspective. This is supposed to put
 the viewer into the shoes of this person, if it applies to them. They will feel a personal attachment to this figure, and thus, whatever
 the poster will call for this person to do. I then painstakingly used the pen tool to cut out the background from the image in-between
 each individual string on the hammock. Then, to make the picture less of the main focus, I decided to mess around with the brightness,
  contrast, saturation, and luminance curves. I was satisfied with a somewhat silhoutteish style for the person sitting on the hammock.  
  I learned a lot about how GIMP works, especially the selections and color grading aspects of GIMP. I had slight experience using
  GIMP and Photoshop from middle and high school, but I mostly relied on tools like the magnetic lasso to do all of the selecting for me.
  This project finally made me realize how powerful the pen tool can be when it comes to selecting edges of an image, and also how tedious
  this process is.  
  In the future, I hope to add text to the top of this image that will make it clear to the viewer why I chose to put a picture
  of somebody relaxing on the top. I will then add a picture to contrast the top, with text urging the viewers to take action.
